# Pandas Notes
This is my collection of Pandas notes and examples, mostly oriented toward security analysts. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

There are lots of examples of using Pandas for statistical or numeric data, but not that many oriented toward log data and string data.

If you are a Pandas beginner, consider starting with [simple_string_matching.ipynb](simple_string_matching.ipynb).

If you know some Pandas and want to see something a little more advanced, [this might be new](finding_commonalities_in_groupby.ipynb).
